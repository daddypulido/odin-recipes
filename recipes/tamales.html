    </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt
    </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
   
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Cut pork into 3 chunks and place in a large saucepan. Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, and salt and cover with water. 
        <br/>Bring to a boil; skim foam from surface. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Remove pork and let cool.
        <br/> Strain broth and reserve.</li>
    <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil while pork is cooking. Add tomatoes, arbol chiles, and guajillo chiles, and boil until chiles are soft,
        <br/> about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, reserving cooking water, and allow to cool.

    </li>
    <li>Place corn husks in a bowl, cover with boiling water, and soak for 30 to 60 minutes. 
        <br/>Drain, place on a work surface, and cover with a clean, damp towel.</li>
    <li>Combine tomatoes, 1/2 cup cooking water, chiles de arbol, guajillo chiles, and cornstarch in a blender; blend until smooth. 
        <br/>Strain tomato sauce through a fine-mesh sieve.

    </li>
    <li>Beat lard with an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy. Combine masa, 1 cup reserved pork broth, 1 tablespoon salt,
        <br/> and baking powder in a separate bowl and mix until smooth. Add masa mixture to lard and mix until it has a smooth cookie dough consistency.
        <br/> Test if the masa is ready by dropping a small ball of masa into a glass of cold water; if it floats, it's ready, if not, 
        <br/>keep beating for a little longer.

    </li>
    <li>Shred cooled pork with 2 forks.

    </li>
    <li>Select 1 wide corn husk or 2 small ones. Spread about 2 tablespoons masa mixture onto the the corn husk, filling it up to 2 inches from the bottom 
        <br/>and 1/4 inch from the top. Add 1 tablespoon of the tomato sauce and pork down the center of the masa mixture. 
        <br/>Fold sides of husk together, 1 over the other. Fold the bottom of the husk over the seam of the 2 folded sides. Repeat with remaining husks.</li>
    <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. 
        <br/>Add tamales with the open side up and cook until filling is heated through and separates from the husk, about 1 hour.
        <br/> Let tamales rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
