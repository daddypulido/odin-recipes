    <h1>Menudo Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../pictures/menudo.png">
    <h2>Menudo is that delicious morning meal Mexicans love to eat every Sunday!</h2>
    <p>Menudo is a very expensive dish for Mexicans to eat every Sunday morning. Reason why it is so expensive is because it is very difficult to make.
        <br/>Reason it is difficult to make is because every single step requires attention to detail and if not done correctly the meal will not come out well.
        <br/>Personally this is my favorite dish to eat, but it is expensive. A bowl is about $25 and that wont be enough to fill an individual.

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>

    <li>In a large pot, bring 1 gallon water to a boil. Place tripe in the pot, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours. 
        <br/>Periodically skim off fat with a spoon. Drain water, reduce heat, and pour in a fresh gallon of water. 
        <br/>Continue to simmer tripe for 2 hours; drain.</li>
    <li>Pour remaining 1 gallon water into the pot with tripe, and bring to a boil. Stir in garlic and 1 white onion.
        <br/> Season with salt, pepper, oregano, and red pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the broiler.

    </li>
    <li>Arrange the de arbol chile peppers on a baking sheet, and broil about 2 minutes, just until they begin to scorch.
        <br/> Remove from heat, slit lengthwise, and remove seeds. In a blender or food processor, blend the de arbol chile peppers
        <br/> and japones chile peppers until very finely chopped. Mix into the pot, and continue cooking 2 hours over low heat.

    </li>
    <li>Mix the hominy into the pot. Continue cooking 1 hour. Serve with remaining onion, cilantro, and lime juice.</li>
